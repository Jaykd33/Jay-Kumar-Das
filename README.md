## 🚀 Hey there, I’m glad you’re here!

Welcome to my corner of GitHub!

I’m an 18-year-old B.Tech student, passionate about learning, building, and constantly evolving—both in code and in life. Whether it’s crunching numbers in Power BI, solving programming puzzles, prepping for an MUN, or building cool, real-world apps, I’m all in. 💡

Here’s what you’ll find around here:

- ⚒️ Projects I’ve built – from data dashboards to smart idea prototypes

- 💻 Code experiments & learnings – trying, failing, retrying, and figuring things out (and loving it)

- 🧠 Real reflections – because let’s be honest, debugging teaches patience like nothing else

I believe growth doesn’t always look perfect—and that’s the beauty of it. Whether you're a fellow student, a curious explorer, or someone looking for inspiration, I hope you find something valuable here.

Let’s connect, build, and grow together—one repo at a time.
You bring the curiosity, I’ll bring the energy 🚴‍♂️🔥
